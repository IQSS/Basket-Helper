# Basket Helper

Assists with installing and setting up Basket for Python. Originally written to assist users with Level 5 workstations at Harvard.

## Introduction

Basket is a module for Python that downloads other modules and dependencies for offline use.

The use case here is that Level 5 workstations have no internet connection for downloading and installing Python modules, so Basket is a helpful tool for finding and downloading module dependencies that can be transferred from a internet-connected machine to the Level 5 workstation.

### Using This Script

This Bash script is not a wrapper for Basket, but assists in installing and setting up Basket on a Mac. For those who may not be Python savvy, it abstracts away some of the confusing aspects of using Python locally.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have Python 2.7 installed
